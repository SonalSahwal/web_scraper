# Download Unsplash Images with Selenium

This Python project uses Selenium to scroll through Unsplash and download images without compromising the quality of the images.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have the following installed:

* Python 3.x
* Selenium: `pip install selenium`
* WebDriver Manager: `pip install webdriver-manager`
* Requests: `pip install requests`
* Google Chrome Browser

## How to Use

1.  **Cloning the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SonalSahwal/web_scraper
    cd unsplash_scraper
    ```

2.  **Run the Script:**
